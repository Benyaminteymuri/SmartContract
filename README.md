# SmartContract

This directory is about deploying the decentralized application (DAPP) based on the Ethereum blockchain from the beginning, which contains two hands-on directories and other needed stuff!


Here we are going to implement a gun shop application based on a smart contract. At the start, we deployed it locally using the Ganache framework. Then we make it online using the Infura platform. For more information, please follow the steps. Good Luck :)
